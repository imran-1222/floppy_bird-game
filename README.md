Floppy Bird is a simple yet addictive arcade game built using Java, inspired by the classic Flappy Bird game. The player controls a bird that continuously moves forward and must navigate through a series of vertically spaced pipes by tapping or pressing a key to make the bird "flop" upward. The objective is to pass through as many pipes as possible without colliding with them or falling to the ground.

Key features of the game include:

Smooth Gameplay Mechanics: Responsive controls for seamless bird movement.
Obstacle Generation: Randomly spaced pipes for increased challenge.
Score Tracking: Real-time scoring based on the number of pipes passed.
Simple Graphics: Retro-style 2D graphics for a nostalgic feel.
Sound Effects: Fun sound cues for flapping, scoring, and collisions.
This game serves as a great Java project for learning game development concepts such as graphics rendering, collision detection, event handling, and game loop implementation.
